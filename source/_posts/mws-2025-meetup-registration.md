[CCSUBS](https://www.ccsubs.org) will host a meetup on June 26, 2025 in Berlin, Germany, co-located with the [Media Web Symposium at Fraunhofer FOKUS](https://mws.fraunhofer.de/program/mws25/).

ðŸš¨ [Register today](https://mws.fraunhofer.de/mws25/registration/) ðŸš¨

Thanks to Fraunhofer FOKUS and our sponsors there is no registration fee. You need to be a [member of CCSUBS](https://ccsubs.org/join/), which is also free... and a great way to connect with other subtitling and captioning professionals.

This event is a follow-up to the successful meet-ups at [NAB](https://ccsubs.org/nab-2024-meetup/) & [MWS 2024](https://ccsubs.org/mws-2024-meetup/) and ongoing online meetings, and is intended to provide room for further discussion on how to deliver excellent accessibility appropriate for the streaming age. There will be presentations on approaches to creating and distributing live captions/subtitles. We will also report on the discussions and conclusions of the CCSUBS and gather feedback from the participants on the topic of live subtitling/captioning.

If you are interested in either presenting on a given topic or leading a discussion on it with the group, please contact [Hewson Maxwell](mailto:hewson.maxwell@redbeemedia.com).
