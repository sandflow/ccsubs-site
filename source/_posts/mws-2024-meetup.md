CCSUBS hosted a meetup in Berlin, co-located with the Media Web Symposium at Fraunhofer Fokus. 25 stakeholders representing content providers, service providers and product vendors reviewed the outcome of the NAB meet-up in April and discussed possible follow-up activities ([presentations](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/193HP6AobJvkGSG6dfafSuT259DvphBDU)).

# Summary

The participants of the meetup confirmed several technical challenges for live subtitling and captioning that have been documented in the NAB meeting report, including:

* Preserving fidelity throughout the chain;
* Maintaining temporal synchronization between audio, video and timed text; and
* Supporting languages with a non-Latin character set.

The variety of protocols and formats used (e.g. by different subtitling and caption vendors) for the transmission of audio, video and subtitles was also identified as major obstacle. There is an obvious need for implementations of modern standards for live subtitle contribution.

While an agreed set of best practices for captioning and subtitling in streaming is desirable in the long term, stakeholders need to respond to market needs immediately. Therefore, company-specific live delivery specifications can initially be published and provided to market participants for consideration. These specifications could form the basis for further collaborative work.

Bill McLaughlin from AI media has started an activity for TTML interop testing. Interested parties can contact him directly. 

Options for setting up a member-led and funded group were presented. There was no preference among the participants. The alternative of doing the work in an existing SDO group was mentioned.
