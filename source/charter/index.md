# CCSUBS group charter

_Approved on 2024-10-28_

## Mission

CCSUBS (the “group”) brings together technical stakeholders from the video streaming ecosystem (pre-recorded and live) to facilitate great end-to-end captions and subtitles experiences worldwide based on existing industry standards.

## Membership
Membership is open to any individual with a legitimate interest in captions and subtitles for streaming. There is no fee.

## Activities

The group may:
* organize meetings to facilitate exchange of information between members; and
* develop documents, including best practices that bring together existing standards, requirements and reports.

The group may reference and constrain existing technical standards but does not develop its own.

## Decision making

Decisions by the group are made by consensus. Consensus does not exist when more than 1/3 of the members object to a decision after all reasonable opportunity for discussion has been provided.

## Confidentiality

Deliberations and deliverables of the group are not confidential. Members must, however, not share them with the public.

Documents developed by the group, including reports and best practices, are expected to be made freely available to the public whenever possible by decision of the group.

## Conduct

Members must act with honesty, integrity, respect, openness, and transparency, and must not engage in any form of personal attacks.

## No collusion

Members must not engage in any discussions on pricing or market division.

## Revisions
This charter may be revised at any time by consensus of the members.

## Background

At NAB 2024 and MWS 2024, experts from across the streaming ecosystem discussed the technical challenges involved in delivering great subtitle and caption experiences. There was broad agreement that persistent collaboration between stakeholders is needed to overcome these challenges, and the creation of a dedicated group would facilitate such collaboration.
